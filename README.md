#The Bakery House 🥐

A modern yet vintage-themed bakery website built as part of my 2nd-year Web Development project. It showcases a cozy and homely design while maintaining clean, responsive layouts. Features include a homepage, product listing, ordering page, and contact section. The project demonstrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, with attention to UI/UX details and aesthetic presentation.
